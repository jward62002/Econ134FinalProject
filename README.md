#Interest in the baobab tree has been growing in popularity following the commercialization of baobab products (seed oil, fruit pulp) with the FDA and EU's recognition of the 
fruit pulp as a food supplement.  It is marketed in the commodity trade as baobab pulp, and the volumes of trade available are highly subject to fluctuation.  Despite the fluctuating
markets, there is still a demand of baobab due to several key products.  Most notably, and what we will be addressing, baobab fruit pulp.  This product is "used in preparing cool 
and hot drinks in rural areas and has recently, become the most popular drink during fasting months all over the country of Sudan" (Eltahir 2020).  Our objective is to optimize the 
number of baobab fruit pulp which in theory boosts the exports of the good.  Increasing exports of this good will hopefully lead to increased GDP of the Ghanese economy.  
The particular link in this chain that we hope to improve with an intervention is the implementation of a model harvesting technique (MHT) as inspired by the (Eltahir 2020) paper.  
We are concerned solely with the outcome variable (baobab_pulps) because sales is a function of the volatile market for this product and is thus beyond the scope of our organization.
This paper will refer to the treatment as MHT, representing those communities who had received a training course on this subject.  This training course includes modules that ensure 
communities harvest selective fruits (not ones prior to ripe), correctly manage termite outbreaks, perfect the timing of a harvest, and overall education on the value of baobab trees
for their local villages.  Other notable factors considered are the bird hunters, as mentioned in the Eltahir paper, "The bird hunters hit small fruits, flowers, buds and immature 
fruit while shooting the birds" (Eltahir 2020).  These hunters can have an overall negative impact on the number of baobab fruit, which is factored into our model.  We depict the 
flow of materials from raw source to marketable product in Fig 1.  First, the number of baobab trees in Ghana, the expansion of which we have deemed beyond the scope of our 
capacities. Next, the popularity of bird hunters on a scale of 1-10 ranked by a field surveyer.  This ranking was conducted over the period of several weeks and we have conviction 
in our methods and data.  Next in line was the amount of fruits per tree, which is a function of tree fertility which we believe we can affect with the implementation of our MHT.  
This MHT, we believe, will effect the processing efficiency.  By processing efficiency we are referring to the farmers ability to pick only ripe fruits and give trees enough time 
to reach maximum capacity.  Without this intervention, we currently believe a considerable number of farmers use ineffective techniques.  This will hopefully increase the number 
of our final product: the baobab fruit pulp.
